# Databases
- A data model is a collection of concepts for describing the data in a database.
- Rules that define the types of things that could exist and how they relate.
- (i.e. relation, document, …)
- A schema is a description of a particular collection of data, using a given data model.
- This defines the structure of database for a data model. Otherwise, you have random bits with no meaning.
- SQL is based on bags (duplicates), not sets (no duplicates).
